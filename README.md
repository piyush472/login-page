# Flask Authentication Web App

    This is my first full stack backend project using Flask and MySQL.
    I made this project to understand how backend works, user authentication, database connection and password security.

    The app allows users to register, login and access a protected dashboard.

# Why I Made This Project

    # I made this project to build strong backend basics.
      While making this app I learned:

        * How login & signup system works

        * How password hashing works

        * How to connect Flask with MySQL

        * How sessions and protected routes work

        * How to debug real errors (duplicate users, hashing issues, db errors)

        * This project helped me understand real backend flow instead of only theory.

# How It Works (Simple Flow)

    * User registers with username and password

    * Password is hashed before saving in database

    * User logs in using credentials

    * Session is created after successful login

    * User can access dashboard only if logged in
